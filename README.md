### Group-2-Assignment
## From a random sample of data, can we determine if more points equal more wins?
 
We sampled 50 random team’s seasons in 12 years’ worth of data for this question. We plotted each team and their corresponding season against how many wins they had against their total points. We plotted the data on a scatter plot so we could visualize any correlations that would occur. What occurred proved our question true – there was a strong correlation between scoring more points in a single season and having a high number of wins in that season. By virtue of scoring more points in a season, that would also result in the average points scored per game to also increase. The average of points of our five greatest data points was 12,675.4 points per season with an average of total wins of 79.6. This compares to our five lowest data points who averaged 3222 points per season with an average of 15 wins per season.
 
The stark contrast in the major difference in points and wins, conclusively shows that if you score more points in a single game there is an extremely high chance you will have a greater number of wins.
 
## Were the yearly total points scored by a team higher with or without LeBron?
 
For the year-on-year data we had to use four seasons worth of data prior to LeBron joining a team and four seasons with LeBron joining a team in order to create a comparison. These comparisons showed that the yearly totals points scored with teams with LeBron James was higher than that without Lebron James. This would assume that more points being scored equate to a greater amount of wins. 
 

 
## Were the yearly average points scored by each team higher with or without LeBron?
 
As we established, the more points scored in a game should result in more wins. For this question we compared the year-on-year season average points scored per game with and without Lebron James.
 
For the Cleveland Cavaliers, four years prior to LeBron joining they averaged ~92 points per game, this resulted in an average of 25 wins per year. When LeBron joined the Cleveland Cavaliers averaged ~96 points per game, this resulted in an average of 75 wins per year.
 
For the Miami Heat, four years prior to LeBron joining they averaged ~95 points per game, this resulted in an average of 32 wins per year. When LeBron joined the Cleveland Cavaliers averaged ~100 points per game, this resulted in an average of 72 wins per year.
 
For the Cleveland Cavaliers, four years prior to LeBron joining they averaged ~94 points per game, this resulted in an average of 23 wins per year. When LeBron joined the Cleveland Cavaliers averaged ~96 points per game, this resulted in an average of 75 wins per year.
 
For the Los Angeles Lakers, four years prior to LeBron joining they averaged ~102 points per game, this resulted in an average of 28 wins per year. When LeBron joined the Cleveland Cavaliers averaged ~96 points per game, this resulted in an average of 55 wins per year.
 
From the four teams we can clearly see when LeBron James joins the team there is a clear and immediate uptake in points and wins. In the first three seasons average wins increased by over 150%.
 
 
## Was the win rate of each team higher with or without LeBron?
 
The previous question has outlined that wins do in fact increase with the inclusion of LeBron James. We can do another year-on-year analysis on win rates to reiterate that finding.
 
The Cleveland Cavaliers four-year average win rate prior to LeBron joining was 30%, and when LeBron joined that increased to 65%.
 
The Miami Heat four-year average win rate prior to LeBron joining was 45%, and when LeBron joined that increased to 73%.
 
Cleveland Cavaliers four-year average win rate prior to LeBron joining was 32%, and when LeBron joined that increased to 66%.
 
Cleveland Cavaliers four-year average win rate prior to LeBron joining was 30%, and when LeBron joined that increased to 63%.
 
Once again there is a clear pattern in LeBron James joining each team the the average of the time period win rate increasing. 

## Was LeBron’s impact a contributing factor to how many wins each team had?

The previous question is a precursor for the answers of this question. To figure out the “impact” LeBron James had on a team's ability to win, we went to the workings of 15-year NBA analyst, John Hollinger. John Hollinger created a metric called a “gamescore” (Impact score for us). This impact score designated weights to various stats from a single game. For example the gamescore formula is PTS + 0.4 * FG - 0.7 * FGA - 0.4*(FTA - FT) + 0.7 * ORB + 0.3 * DRB + STL + 0.7 * AST + 0.7 * BLK - 0.4 * PF - TOV.  As we can see AST or assist are assigned a weighting of 0.7, whereas PF or a personal foul is assigned a weighting of 0.4. This is because getting an assist is considered having a higher positive impact on the game and therefore yields a higher weighting. The logic behind the impact score metric is 

< 10 the individual would have had a negative impact on the game and wouldn't have contributed to a win
10 - 20 this is considered a “good” game, and the individual may have had a neutral impact on the game and there is potential they could have contributed to a win 
20 - 30 this is considered extremely positive and there is a high chance that the individual had a strong positive impact on the game and the teams win
40 + is considered to be an outstanding performance, and the correlation between the individual's performance and the team winning is almost absolute. 

As we can see Lebron never drops below an impact score of 10 which is an incredible feat in itself. From these graphs we can see the correlation always being positive as he progresses throughout his career. The strongest clustering of data points and strongest positive correlation falls with the Miami Heat and the Cleveland Cavaliers the second time around. This is expected as this is where he had the greatest success. The consistent clustering between the 20 - 30 impact score region tells us that there is a high chance that he had a strong positive impact on the game and the teams win. 

These graphs tell us another story of the NBA since the early 2000’s. The data points on the Y-axis tend to start having higher minimums as the years progress. This provides a commentary on the NBA and how it has evolved over the years. A higher scoring, less defense and more three point shoot is increasing the game points per game. Although Lebrons Los Angeles Lakers graph would presume to have the highest success as the impact scores are higher and the game points are higher, the average win rate for his time there is only 63%. This compares to his average win rate at Miami Heat of 77% and Cleveland Cavaliers win rate of 66%. 

This is a remarkable finding as Lebrons impact scores and average team points scored per game may be the highest, this has not translated into the most wins.
