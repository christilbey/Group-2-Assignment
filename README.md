# Group-2-Assignment
From a random sample of data, can we determine if more points equal more wins?
 
We sampled 50 random team’s seasons in 12 years’ worth of data for this question. We plotted each team and their corresponding season against how many wins they had against their total points. We plotted the data on a scatter plot so we could visualize any correlations that would occur. What occurred proved our question true – there was a strong correlation between scoring more points in a single season and having a high number of wins in that season. By virtue of scoring more points in a season, that would also result in the average points scored per game to also increase. The average of points of our five greatest data points was 12,675.4 points per season with an average of total wins of 79.6. This compares to our five lowest data points who averaged 3222 points per season with an average of 15 wins per season.
 
The stark contrast in the major difference in points and wins, conclusively shows that if you score more points in a single game there is an extremely high chance you will have a greater number of wins.
 
Were the yearly total points scored by a team higher with or without LeBron?
 
For the year-on-year data we had to use four seasons worth of data prior to LeBron joining a team and four seasons with LeBron joining a team in order to create a comparison. These comparisons showed that the yearly totals points scored with teams with LeBron James was higher than that without Lebron James. This would assume that more points being scored equate to a greater amount of wins. 
 

 
Were the yearly average points scored by each team higher with or without LeBron?
 
As we established, the more points scored in a game should result in more wins. For this question we compared the year-on-year season average points scored per game with and without Lebron James.
 
For the Cleveland Cavaliers, four years prior to LeBron joining they averaged ~92 points per game, this resulted in an average of 25 wins per year. When LeBron joined the Cleveland Cavaliers averaged ~96 points per game, this resulted in an average of 75 wins per year.
